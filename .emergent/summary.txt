**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend) is in place. The app has a glassmorphic UI and includes pages for Home, Services, Projects, About, Booking, and a new Careers page. A comprehensive admin dashboard has been built, allowing a super admin to manage services, projects, site-wide themes, contact information, and other admins. A Content Management System (CMS) has been implemented to allow text customization, though not all site content is dynamic yet. Features like OTP-based password reset, hourly booking, and an admin approval flow for new signups are also implemented.

**Last working item**:
The agent was implementing a new Careers page and a corresponding Applications management tab in the admin dashboard, as requested by the user. This involved creating a new frontend page, adding backend models and API endpoints for job applications, and integrating the new sections into the admin panel.

- **Last item agent was working:** Implementing the Careers page and the Applications tab in the admin dashboard, and expanding the CMS to make more site content dynamic.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y (partially, agent confirmed the  page renders correctly)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Incomplete & Buggy Content Management System (P0)**
-   **Issue 2: Logo Upload Not Implemented (P1)**
-   **Issue 3: Recurring MongoDB ObjectId Serialization Error (P1)**

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1: Incomplete & Buggy Content Management System**
    - **Description:** The user reported that changes made in the Content tab of the admin dashboard do not persist correctly after saving and reloading. Furthermore, many text elements on the site (e.g., the Professional Audio Post Production subtitle on the homepage, footer text) are still hardcoded and not editable from the admin panel.
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent expanded the backend content model and started updating frontend components like the  to use dynamic data. The input lag issue in the content tab was also fixed. However, the work is incomplete.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Investigate the  update endpoint in  and the  function in  to diagnose why content changes are not persisting reliably.
        2.  Refactor , , , and other pages to fetch all their text content from the dynamic content API instead of using hardcoded strings.
        3.  Add fields to the backend  model and the frontend  component for all remaining hardcoded text.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fulfills the user's core requirement for full, persistent control over all website text from the admin dashboard.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None

- **Issue 2: Logo Upload Not Implemented**
    - **Description:** The user requested the ability to upload a logo from their computer/phone. The current implementation in the Content tab only accepts a URL.
    - **Attempted fixes:** None. The agent implemented the CMS but missed this specific requirement for the logo field.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  In , change the logo input field in the  component from a text input to a file input.
        2.  Modify the save logic to handle  for the logo upload.
        3.  Ensure the file is sent to an appropriate backend endpoint (e.g., the existing image upload endpoint) and the returned path is saved in the site content data.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** It allows the user to easily change the site logo as requested.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None

- **Issue 3: Recurring MongoDB ObjectId Serialization Error**
    - **Description:** The application has a history of 500 errors due to  not being JSON serializable. This is a high risk for any new endpoints.
    - **Attempted fixes:** Ad-hoc fixes were made in the past. The agent has been more systematic recently, but new endpoints for job applications were just added and need verification.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Review the new job application endpoints (, etc.) in .
        2.  Confirm that any data returned from the  collection correctly serializes  to a string, preferably using Pydantic model configurations.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Ensures API stability and prevents critical runtime errors.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED (for new endpoints)
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** backend
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete and Test Careers & Applications Flow (P0)**
    - **Description:** The initial code for the Careers page and Applications tab has been written, but it needs to be made fully dynamic and tested end-to-end.
    - **Where to resume:**
        1.  Update  to fetch its text content from the dynamic content API.
        2.  Perform a full end-to-end test: submit an application via the form, log in as admin, navigate to the Applications tab, and verify the submission is displayed correctly.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** A fully functional job application system as requested by the user.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    - **Blocked on something:** Depends on Issue 1 for dynamic text.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Test Booking Confirmed Email Notification (P1):** The backend logic to send an email upon booking approval is in place but has not been tested. This requires an admin to approve a booking and verify the client receives the correct confirmation email.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Admin Dashboard & RBAC:** Fixed broken functionality, implemented dynamic theming, corrected image handling, and established robust role-based access control (super admin vs. basic admin) with suspension capabilities.
- **Authentication & OTP:** Implemented a full OTP lifecycle: Forgot Password for users/admins, Resend OTP, and a super admin approval flow for new admin registrations.
- **Booking Flow:** Enhanced the booking page with hourly input for specific services, a cost notice, and a post-booking signup prompt. Modified the email flow to distinguish between an Enquiry Received and a Booking Confirmed.
- **Content Management System:** Created Content and Contact Info tabs in the admin panel, allowing the super admin to manage most site text, branding colors, and contact details.
- **Careers Feature:** Created the new  with an application form and added an Applications tab to the admin dashboard, including the necessary backend infrastructure.
- **UI/UX Fixes:** Resolved an image opacity issue that was making images unclear. Updated  and  to use dynamic content.

- : Contains all API logic, including the new endpoints for job applications and the expanded content management system.
- : The central hub for all admin functionality, including the new Applications tab and the expanded Content tab.
- : Needs to be refactored to consume dynamic content from the CMS.
- : Updated to be fully dynamic.
- : Updated to be fully dynamic.
- : New file containing the job application form.
- : Serves as the provider for all site-wide dynamic content (theme, text, etc.).
- : Updated with the new  route.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Priority 1 is the CMS:** The user's primary goal is full control over the website's content. Fixing the persistence bug and making all remaining text editable (, , etc.) is the top priority.
- **Don't Forget Logo Upload:** The user has explicitly asked to upload a logo from their computer, not just provide a URL. This is a pending requirement for the CMS.
- **Test New Endpoints:** The job application feature was just added. It needs a full end-to-end test, from form submission to viewing the application in the admin panel. Pay attention to potential  serialization errors in the new API routes.
- **Follow the User's Lead:** The user is providing very detailed, iterative feedback. Address all points from their last message before concluding the task.
